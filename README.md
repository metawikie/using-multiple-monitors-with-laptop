## How to set up to connect two monitors

Since everything is ready, you can start connecting the two monitors to your laptop.

* Plug the cable of the first external monitor to the correct video port on your laptop. So I plug the VGA cable of the first external monitor into the VGA port on my laptop.
* Plug the cable of the second external monitor to the other correct port on your laptop. So I plug the HDMI cable of the second external monitor into the HDMI port on my laptop.
* On your laptop, right-click an empty area of your desktop:
* If you are using Windows 10, click Display settings. If you are using Windows 8/7, click Screen resolution.
* You will see three displays labeled with 1, 2 and 3 in display mode. Generally speaking, the display 1 is the monitor of your laptop, and the display 2 and 3 are the external monitors. (What if you can’t see the plugged-in monitors?)
* Click the display 2, and select Extend desktop to this display in Multiple displays, and click Apply. 
* Click the display 3, and select Extend desktop to this display in Multiple displays, and click Apply. 
* Click OK to finish the settings, and you can now use the three monitors on your laptop.
